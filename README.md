# FLUTTER — Mobile Development Learning Collection

A collection of small projects and experiments used to learn mobile development with FLUTTER. Each project is self-contained and focuses on a specific concept, widget, or platform feature.

## Location
This README lives at:
`/c:/Users/matth/Desktop/Mobile Development/FLUTTER/README.md`

## Contents
- projects/ — individual FLUTTER apps and experiments
- assets/ — shared images, fonts, and other resources
- docs/ — notes, design sketches, and learning resources
- scripts/ — helper scripts (emulator setup, CI helpers)
- README.md — this file

## Goals
- Practice core FLUTTER concepts: widgets, state management, navigation, and layouts
- Explore platform APIs: sensors, storage, permissions, and networking
- Build small, focused apps to reinforce learning and demonstrate techniques
- Maintain readable examples that can be reused or extended
